# Rock Paper Scissors

We are going to build a simple game. Users are allowed to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors by visiting one of the following URLs:

 - [http://localhost:3000/rock](http://localhost:3000/rock)
 - [http://localhost:3000/paper](http://localhost:3000/paper)
 - [http://localhost:3000/scissors](http://localhost:3000/scissors)

And we will tell them whether they won or lost.

### Part 1

Add support for each URL one at a time. For each one,

 1. Complete the RCAV and display "Hi!" to prove that you did so. Make up whatever names you want for the controller and action.
 1. Now step back into the action and write some logic to determine whether the player won or lost. Put the computer move and the outcome into instance variables.
 1. In the view template, display the instance variables. Format it a little with some markup and some copy.

#### Optional

Once you have completed the above for all three URLs,

 1. Add links to each page to get to the other pages.
 1. Link to Bootstrap and make it look even nicer.
